# hello-world
This is my first ever program I am writing on GitHub. Although I'm not experienced. I want to create the habit of coding on GitHub at least four times a week for 30 minutes each time. 

I just finsihed my junior year of college. I'm starting a tech startup at St. John's University, but it's a small one. It's for meal plans for college students. I did it because it was a big problem for me. The main tech guy in my team is my cousin. He's beeen teaching me how to code for the past six months. And I'm taking several online courses through Udacity, Udemy, freecodecamp, and Coursera.
